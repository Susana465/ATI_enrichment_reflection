I am not sure if because of this more unique way of application/selection, or because it was meant to be, or simply due to chance, the enrichment cohort that was selected for 2022/2023, of which I was part of, was full of people who were kind, open and intelligent in many ways.

It was very refreshing to interact with other PhD students who were not doing the same research I was, but we could still relate on the hardships and successes of each other.

This was thanks to a Grassroots Student training fund that the Institute has made available for students to organise training and skills development activities.

Being part of these events has been crucial for my PhD, as it enabled me to have conversations about bias, ethics and reproducibility with people who were knowledgeable in these fields. \n\nI would encourage any PhD student, especially those of historically marginalised backgrounds to look into this scheme.
