# ATI_enrichment_reflection
- This is a repository where I've shared some reflections on my time as an Enrichment student.

- Feel free to contact me (s1350728@ed.ac.uk) if you would like to discuss anything regarding the enrichment scheme.

# Quarto:

- This is a report written using a [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/). The components here are:

## YAML files

- The [`_quarto.yml`](_quarto.yml) file contains the initial configuration of the book.

## Markdown file
- The [`index.qmd`](index.qmdl) is where the text is written

## Output directory:

- [`/_book`](/_book/): By default, [quarto book output](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-output.html) is written to the _book directory of your project. 
- This book renders a [`.docx`](/_book/Enrichment-scheme-reflections.docx) version and a [`.pdf`](/_book/Enrichment-scheme-reflections.pdf) version, as can be seen in this folder.

# How to use:
- You can directly download the pdf or docx files in the _book output directory.

- Or you can fork this repo and use this report as a template for your own work.

# Licence:

- Please feel free to re-use this material and credit me through linking this repository.
