# Quarto:

- This is a report written using a [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/). The components here are:

## YAML files

- The [`_quarto.yml`](_quarto.yml) file contains the initial configuration of the book.

## Markdown file
- The [`index.qmd`](index.qmdl) is where the text is written

## Output directory:

- [`/_book`](/_book/): By default, [quarto book output](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-output.html) is written to the _book directory of your project, this is where the final rendered [`.pdf`](/_book/3rd-Year-Report.pdf) lives.
